**Today's Progress**: Learned all about *regular expressions* on *regex* on javascript.

**Thoughts:** I really heard about regex as a neat way to match characters, special characters and substring inside a string. Even I can replace those matches.

**Link to work:** [Regular Expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)
